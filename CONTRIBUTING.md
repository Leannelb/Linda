# How to Contribute

I'd love to accept your patches and contributions to this project. There are
just a few small guidelines you need to follow.

Please make an issue first and ask if you may contribute to a specific feature, 
so that it is inline with this project's goals and to make sure only one person
is working on a feature at a time.

## Git commit messages

I will enforce "proper" git commit message usage for everyone's sanity. A good
article on this is [A note about git commit messages](https://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html).
I *WILL* ask you to modify your commit messages if they do not follow these guidelines.
(I will not go to the extreme about this, I simply want to have some baseline for standards.

## Code reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. I
use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult
[GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more
information on using pull requests.
